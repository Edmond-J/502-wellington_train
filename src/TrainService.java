/**
 * TrainService
 * A particular train service running on a train line.
 * A train service is specified by a list of times that train leaves
 *  each station along the train line.
 *  (it the train does not stop at a station, then the corresponding time is -1)
 * A TrainService object contains
 *  - The TrainLine that the service runs on
 *  - a ID of the train (the name of the line concatenated with the starting time of the train)
 *  - a list of times (integers representing 24-hour time, eg 1425 for 2:45pm), one for
 *     each station on the train line. A time is -1 if the train does not stop at the station.
 * The getStart() method will return the first real time in the list of times
